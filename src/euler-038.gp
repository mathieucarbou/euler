/*
    M is multiplied by 1, 2, 3, ... to n

    M cannot end with 5, otherwise M*2 will ends with 0

    918273645 is not the biggest, so the result will begin with 9 and M has at least 2 digits
        => M*a=9...

    98 x (1,2) => 9|8196 (too few digits)
    987 x (1,2) => 987|1974 (too few digits)
    9876 x (1,2) => 9876|19752 (9-digits)

    918273645 is not the biggest. Next is: 9183

    9183 x (1,2) => 9183|18366
